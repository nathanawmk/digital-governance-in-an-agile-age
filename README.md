# digital-governance-in-an-agile-age
Is governance in an "agile, move fast, fail fast" ethos diametrically opposed to each other? Quite on the contrary. Though governance may initially seem inimical to such an ethos, I argue that governance can in fact foster such as an ethos and achieve digital hyperspeed through defining good guardrails and targets.
