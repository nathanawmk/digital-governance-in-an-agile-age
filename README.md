# digital-governance-in-an-agile-age
Is governance in an "agile, move fast, fail fast" ethos diametrically opposed to each other? Quite on the contrary. Though governance may initially seem inimical to such an ethos, I argue that governance can in fact foster such as an ethos and achieve digital hyperspeed through defining good guardrails and targets.

Guardrails could mean principles and regulations. 

For starters, guard rails exist to protect, not only to limit. Guardrails are not inhibitions per se nor hoops that need to be conquered or to be skirted. Instead of lamenting over the existence of guardrails, one needs to understand the spirit of the guardrails (law). 

It is in the interpretation of the guardrails that the most creative solutions can be derived. One needs to interpret guardrails as living instead of dead. For example, if a piece or regulation states that you must enforce dual control. Instead of interpretting this to the T, one needs to under the goals and purpose behind such a regulation.

The definition of dual control is this: A security procedure requiring two people (or possibly processes or devices) to cooperate in gaining authorized access to a system resource (data, files, devices). In short, separation of duty. 

The goal is to avoid abuse. Is there any other mechanisms other than Dual Control that can avoid abuse by a single individual? Perhaps there are. 

With this example, I have clearly illustrated that guardrails need to be clearly understood especially its goals. Guardrails can also stop to be relevant thus guardrails laid out by a governance organisation has to be refreshed.
